[Later edited by Adam to correct the typos and contradictions :-) ]

You may remember, in the dim and distant past, there was suggestion of an 
Ixion Rally this year (born of an ObCar discussion between Mand & ObBroken 
Richiemouse).

Now, after weeks of discussion, hours of software engineering[1] and 
minutes of testing, the Ixion Rally 2003 Software Infrastructure Thing is 
ready for you to pose your questions.

The rally is open for the submission of questions now, and will be open for 
answers between 1st March and 1st October - hopefully this means that 
February will provide a good choice of questions ready for eager question 
answerers.

All entrants have gotta submit an easy question (and may ask up to 2 easy & 
1 hard one). The onerous obligations of question askers are (a) to mark 
other bods' answers to their questions, and (b) to try to meet folk 
passin' by. Hopefully they'll choose interesting questions, or at least 
questions which require riding along good roads :-)

Object Of The Game
------------------

To ride bikes, have fun, meet ixies and not FC.

Questions
---------

The idea is that all participants submit questions 'near' them, where 
'near' is (in their judgement) within about 10 minutes ride of their 
preferred iximeeting place (home, pub, den of iniquity).

Questions _might_ need some words in the answer, but they should definitely 
be answerable with a photo of self/bike in some distinctive pose[2] for 
public ridicule. Folk will be able to enjoy other folks answers (to 
questions they've already answered) during the event, and of course 
everyone can see all the photos when it's all over.

Clearly this assumes that rallyists will have access to digital cameras, 
scanners, or a combination of film camera, stamp, envelope, and the 
address of the ixiscanningbureau. This may seem elitist, but we do also 
assume that rallyists will have access to computers, internet connections 
and motorbikes[3], so it's already a rich man's sport.

There are but two types of questions:

  * "easy" (5 pts):
     A question to check that the answerer has been to a place, rather
     than that they're really really clever and prepared to ride off-road
     for 10 miles and then climb a mountain to consult the oracle. It
     should be easily accessible from the public road - ideally they
     should be able to include their bike in the photo[4].

  * "hard" (8 pts):
    This kind of question can be a bit harder and require a little more 
    adventure - if it requires off-road riding or any significant (to an
    ixi) amount of walking, or if it's dodgy in wet/cold/dark, make sure
    you note that in the question.

When submitting a question, you need to provide the streetmap/multimap URL 
roughly centered on the answer zone. You should also provide a "model 
answer" and ideally a "model photo" with what you'd hope to be submitted 
by answerers.



Points
------

You might be surprised, given its crapness, that the point-scoring scheme 
took a lot of discussion and was hard to agree on ... it's still not cast 
in stone, though hopefully the event is more about fun than about 
vanquishing other ixis, so the points stuff is mainly (IMHO) for interest 
anyway.

There are three kinds of points for answering a question, awarded thusly:

  * the answerer's points comprise wot you get for attempting it at all,
    and a few more if by some fluke/bribery/threats your answer is marked
    as correct:

    * for attempting it at all:
      number_of_ixies_met
      + 0.01 * miles_ridden * bike_size_weighting

      ... where bike_size_weighting is:
        3    for <= 50cc;
        1.25 for <= 250cc;
        0.75 for >  250cc

      IMHO ixicouples count as 2, though then of course if such a couple
      do clues together they score at least 1 ixies_met point ... and if a
      group go out doing clues, they get the whole group's worth. But I
      spose that encourages groups of ixies to ride around[5], so that's
      no bad thing[6].

      The "miles_ridden" is just the amount of ridden while answering this
      question(if it was a 10 mile journey on its own, count 10; If it was
      a 1 mile detour on a 10 mile journey, count 1; If you answered 3
      questions in a 10 mile journey, the 3 mileage answers should total
      10).

      (As an example for ixies_met, if you go out in a group of 5 to do 3
      questions, and stop at an ixicouple's house for a cuppa on the way,
      count 4 (the others in your group of 5) for *each* of the questions,
      and put the 2 for the ixicouple against any *one* of the questions)

      At the moment, the scores are rounded to the nearest int for each
      question, but we might change that at some point :-)

      I don't think there's any need to be strict, wot with it being all 
      for fun and none of us likely to cheat each other, so this is more
      about giving a clue wot's meant rather than laying down the law.

    * extra points for getting it right:
      easy question: 5
      hard question: 8

  * the asker's points for asking the question:
    0.2 * answerer_points



Without further ado
-------------------

Surf on over to:

  http://eider.quacky.co.uk/ixion/

You'll need to register just like wot you do/did with the trackday booking 
stuff. The email address you provide will be used for confirming 
registration, nagging you about unmarked answers to your questions. The 
address (and any phone numbers you provide) *will be shown to other 
rallyists* for them to use if they're planning to answer your questions 
and want to arrange to meet.

Any questions/suggestions, let the rally organiser cabal (Mand, 
Richiemouse, AndyC, Han, Mik Reed, Robin & me) know on 
rallyorg@ixion.org.uk. Any probs etc with the software, pls send to 
eider-admin@quacky.co.uk

[1] There's still some clicky-map stuff to do, so you can click where
you want to be and it'll show you the nearest unanswered questions.

[2] Another thing on the todo list is to arrange some RateMyRallyPhoto.com 
scheme, with extra points and/or pointless prizes for the most artistic / 
distasteful / pr0nographic photos

[3] sorry Ben, it's motorbikes only.

[4] This probly means that Inner Cities should be avoided, cos your bike 
will be stolen as you walk across the road (then you'll be mugged and your 
camera nicked)

[5] No, not including Cadwell, Hardraw etc. ... you're so funny ;->

[6] although Adny wouldn't agree
