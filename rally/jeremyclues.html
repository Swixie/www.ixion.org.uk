Jeremy's Question-Setting Guide
</H1>

<P>Glorious winner of IxiRally'03 offers this advice for the setting of questions ...

<UL>
<LI>Make something about the question appealing, be it a clever clue, an 
interesting place to go or good riding to get there.  Questions that 
have none of these things tend to be very tedious.  Two out of the three 
would be a good thing to aim for.

<LI>Choose questions where parking for several bikes is easy and safe.

<LI>Consider if the place will be there/open for the duration of the rally, 
and that rallyists may be answering the question at night or in the 
dark.

<LI>Think about how close the answer can be approached - getting good photos 
of distant objects is tricky, and nigh on impossible in the dark.

<LI>Don't deliberately mis-mark the location of the answer.  If you want to 
make it harder be clever with the clue.

<LI>Ixies are a bunch of geeky internerds so make some of your question 
answerable from web searches (they still have to go there to take a 
photo).

<LI>Ixies are a bunch of geeky internerds so make some of your questions 
unanswerable from web searches (they have to go there and search around 
(briefly, not for hours) to find the answer).

<LI>Don't set questions in towns/cities unless the clue/answer is 
particularly clever/interesting.  There is no good riding to be had in 
towns, and it is unlikely any Ixies are going to find your local or 
place of work worth visiting.

<LI>Don't set questions in towns/cities.  It's worth mentioning twice <TT>;-)</TT>
