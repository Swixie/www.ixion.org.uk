Ixion Rally 2004
</H1>

<P>The 2003 IxiRally was won by Jeremy Sagar.

<P><B>The 2004 Ixion Rally runs from 1st April to 1st November</B>

<P>At the moment, we think:
<UL>
<LI>It's open to all ixies (and only ixies)

<LI>The cost of entry is to provide clues for locations near you, and to
mark people's answers to your clues.
<BR>Here are 
<A HREF="clues.html">the draft Guidelines For Clue-Givers</A>,
and (with the benefit of experience)
<A HREF="jeremyclues.html">Jeremy's Additional Advice For Clue-Givers</A>,

<LI>You have to do it by motorbike.

<LI>Part of the point of the rally is to give ixies an excuse to meet, so we'll
need an email address and ideally a phone number so that folk doing clues near
you can arrange to meet.
<BR>It's understandable that you might not want ixies to visit you at home
(<I>e.g.</I> if you have children, cats, or an embarrassing spouse), but it's
fine to meet them at the local pub or wotever.

<LI>bonus points will be awarded for doing it on smaller bikes, for meeting
ixies while doing their clues, for providing interesting photos of your visits
... and anything else we think of.

</UL>

<p>The rally is administered by the white-heat of computer technology, with questions and answers and everyfink managed by <i>Eider</i>. So,
