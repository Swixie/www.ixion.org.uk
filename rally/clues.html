Ixion Rally - Guidelines for Clue-Givers
</H1>

<P>The cost of entry to the
<A HREF="/rally/">Ixion Rally</A>
is that you provide one or more clues, and mark people's answers to your clues.
We distinguish "<I>Rally</I>" clues, and "<I>Treasure-hunt</I>" clues. More
points will be awarded for the latter, cos they're harder.

<P>All that's <U>required</U> is one rally-style clue, but if you feel inclined, and there's enough of interest round your way, feel free to submit a couple.

Here are some guidelines for your clues:

<H2>Rally Clues</H2>
<P><I>Rally</I> clues are just to prove that you've been to the place,
<I>e.g.</I> "what's the colour of the clock face on the church?</I>
<UL>
<LI>Must be within 10 minutes ride<A HREF="#1">[1]</A> of your house
<LI>Must give a placename that
<A HREF="http://www.multimap.com/">multimap</A>
or
<A HREF="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/">streetmap</A>
understands - <I>e.g.</I> not <I>Sutton</I>, but <I>Sutton, Doncaster</I>.
<BR>(When you submit your clue, you'll be asked for a streetmap URL, and you
can assume that the solver has seen it)
<LI>You must be able to take an acceptable photograph of your bike in the place
from the road (car parks are dodgy if they're closed, or used for markets)
</UL>

<H2>Treasure-Hunt Clues</H2>
<P><I>Treasure-Hunt</I> clues are slightly trickier, and should need a bit of
thinking - not exactly MENSA-level stuff, but harder than just looking at a
clock to see what colour it is. I STFW and found some treasure hunt questions,
these show the kind of thing:

<UL>
<LI><I>Who was the High Flyer who died for the sake of his health?</I>
<LI><I>Which house has the wrong colour rose and out of date venison?</I>
<LI><I>On which house wouldn't the sun shine?</I>
<LI><I>Our sleeping policeman wants information on Dr Who's enemy. What number
should you ring?</I>
</UL>

<P>Of course, these need the solver to be in the vicinity first: to get them
there can be part of the clue, or you can just tell 'em.

<P>More about the clues:
<UL>
<LI>Must be within 20 minutes ride<A HREF="#1">[1]</A> of your house
<LI>Might require up to 10 minutes off-road riding, but must mention that,
should be suitable for <I>e,g,</I> R1150GS or Tiger, and of course it must be
legal <TT>:-&gt;</TT>
<LI>Might require walking, but only up to 10 minutes (for the ISO standard
Ixi-in-full-kit)
</UL>

<P><A NAME=#1>[1]</A> where riding time is measured at "normal pace" in sunny-summer-Sunday-afternoon road and traffic conditions
