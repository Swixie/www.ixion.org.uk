<H1 align=center>Ixion - Associate of <TT>amazon.co.uk</TT></H1>
Ixion is an associate of
<TT>amazon.co.uk</TT>,
which means that the group gets commission from stuff bought
through these pages - at no extra cost to you.

<H2>How to help ixion through <TT>amazon.co.uk</TT></H2>
Find the amazonian thing you want, and then mosey on up to your browser's address bar.
<BR>You'll find it goes a little something like this:

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<PRE><TT>http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340769211/</TT></PRE>
</DIV>

<P><I>(There'll be some cruft to the right of that, but this is the important bit)</I>
<P>All you need to do is replace the cruft with the magic associate tag <TT><B>ixion-21</B></TT>,
so it reads:

<DIV ALIGN=center>
<TT>http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0340769211/<B>ixion-21</B></TT>
</DIV>

<P>And you're done.
<P>(Actually if you make it look <I>exactly</I> like that you'll have a (very good) book about WWII,
so the product number will probly be different for you)

For our colonial cousins buying through amazon.com, it's the same procedure as above,
but the associate id is <B>ixion-20</B>
