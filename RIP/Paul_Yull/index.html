<H1 align=center>Ixion - A Tribute to Paul Yull</H1>

<p align=center>
It is with deep regret that we mourn the passing of Paul Yull.
</p>

<p>
Paul died doing something we all love, riding his motorcycle.
He was a well respected member of Ixion, with many noticable postings and
trip reports, as well as the author of an excellent guide to motorcycle touring:
<a href="http://www.mojo.org/touring.html">Paul's Touring FAQ</a>.
Some of his exploits were reported in:
<a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~kmbennett/alps97/index.htm">Paul and Marvin's Excellent
Adventure</a>.
</p>

<p>
His funeral was
held on Friday 29 May 1998 at 10:20.
As a gesture of respect, only mail dedicated to the memory of Paul was allowed
through Ixion between 10:00 and 14:00.
Some of these tributes are reprinted below:

I kept reading for the joke.

It didn't appear.

This is the first biker I've 'known' who has lost their life doing what they
enjoy most.  It is not a feeling I wish to repeat.

Please pass on my deepest sympathies to all concerned.

Jeff,

   I'm bitterly and deeply shocked. I only met Paul a couple of times, and
he was a good bloke.
I know he was good friend of yourself and Marvin and various others on
Ixion.
Please pass on my deepest condolences and sympathies to his girlfriend,
family and friends.

If there is anything that can be done to help in some way, please let me
know.

God's Speed Paul.

  yours in sadness,

Dave Lippett.

&gt;I am very sorry to have to tell the list that Paul was killed last night
&gt;riding home from Sherburn.
What is there to say at a time like this?

Us cowards fall back on quotes:
"What will be will be, and what is written cannot be erased.
But let it also be written that I grieve, too."

Thanks for 'phoning, Jeff.

&lt;meta http-equiv="speechless" content="30-at-least"&gt;

The last time I was with Paul was last Thursday, 14th May, 1998.
Paul, Jeff and I took a run out of an evening in the newly arrived
sunshine. The summer was back and we had a fine blast taking in Ripon,
Masham, Leyburn, Hawes, Buckden, Kettlewell and Threshfield. A
riproaring time was had by all and, after a fag, Paul followed me back
to Leeds to get onto the M62 for home while Jeff made his own way. I
last saw him in my mirrors as we waved and went our separate ways at the
junction of the A6120 Leeds Ring Road and A65 Skipton Road.

If I hadn't done the committee meeting at WYAM I would've been at
Sherbert and I'd've had that last chance to take the piss and have the
piss taken in return.

&gt;From what Jeff says, he died instantly and wouldn't have known very much
about it all. I believe he's gone on to better things and will be having
a whale of a whale of a time on the great twisties in the sky. So WTF am
I crying? I'm feeling sorry for myself because I lost a good mate. I'm
feeling sorry for myself because I'll not get the chance to stuff him up
the outside on an Alpine hairpin again. I'll never hear those pipes
rattle the windows in a French farmhouse and I'll never do so many other
things with that man I admired greatly.

If anyone's got a copy of "Paul and Marvin's Excellent Adventure" from
last summer, would you mail me a copy, please, 'cos that was the
cementing of a friendship like few others I will ever know.

Needless to say, I'll be at the funeral and if anyone wants crash
(oops!) space, you're welcome at my building site.

I never met Paul, and never corresponded with him either. I read 
the account of his trip through France, and laughed out loud. It
made me forget why I was reading it. Based just on that second-
hand acquaintance, I guess Paul was a guy with a lot of life in
him. I wish I had known him. 

My sincere sympathies to his nearest and dearest on their loss.

 My memories of Paul will always been the sound and sight of the

northern voice.

I know it will mean little to those suffering deeply at the moment,  but
please pass on my very sincere condolances and deepest sympathy.

Please excuse the general reply, too many very caring Ixies to reply to
individually, but marvin, Jane, Richard and I went to see Sheridan yesterday
afternoon and passed on the many messages from you all.
She is bearing up well in the circumstances but nothing will ever make up
for her loss particularly as it now seems that it was the other guys fault
and if he recovers the police are looking at prosecuting him went all the
picture is pieced together.
The funeral is looking still like Friday but it will be midweek before this
is confirmed.
Sheridan is very happy with the idea of Ixies attending so come if U
can/want. marvin will stay here overnight on Thurs as can anyone else who
wants so please declare your intentions as soon as poss. It would be better
not to attend the actual funeral on a bike or bikegear in deference to his
parents. If U come on a bike here marvin & I should have enough car spaces
to cover and bring a change of gear.
Am intending to visit the actual site this week, feel a strong need to see
where he died and touch the place, if U feel the same let me know.
Still cannot get this matter out of my mind all the day/night and Jesus I
miss him!

Like everybody else I was stunned when I came in to work on Tuesday and
saw the news about Paul. I'd met Paul a couple of times, at Cadwell and
at the karting do, and he was a really friendly and nice bloke. I'd
have liked to get to know him better, now I'll never have the chance.
My deepest condolences to his girlfriend, family and friends.

Here is something that Paul posted to the list last year:

I didn't believe it, still don't really.

So, what can I say? I met Paul a couple of times, and for all the
pissing off we did of each other on Ixion, I thought he was an alright
bloke.

It's ridiculous I know, but it's a strange feeling knowing that
someone you've met - and hoped to meet again - is dead. I was going to
be trite and say "no longer with us", but the fact is he's dead. I
still don't believe it.

...
I still don't believe it. RIP Paul.

I don't know what to say either.

I met Paul twice, once for a very pleasant ride round Yorkshire

I now find myself staring out of the window at the bike and wondering
if it's worth it.

My condolences to all those touched by this.

From: Richard Moore

Dear all

I'm back at work and at my PC again; before catching up on the digests I
wanted to talk about Paul.

Late Friday afternoon I was in the back yard fettling the bike when Jeff
rang to say that Paul had been killed on the way back from Sherburn the
previous evening. I sort of half took in what he was saying and went back
into the yard in a daze. 

I first met Paul when Ixies started meeting at Sherburn, which would I
suppose have been early last year. When the suggestion was made it turned
out that we'd been going separately and not actually met. Soon we had a
regular Thursday night crew of Paul, marvin, Jeff, Dominic and myself.
I'd been a bit sporadic of late; last Thursday was only my second
consecutive week back after a gap of a couple of months. A pleasant, warm 
evening with room to sit outside, as I recall, bikes came and went, Jeff
came on the GSX with his odd but effective extra light on the front, 
Dominic returned on the Bandit, I asked him when he was getting it re-
sprayed, he and Paul "criticised" his current employer for whom Paul used 
to work, Paul looked agape at my matt black paint job and told me I'd 
double
the bike's value by filling it with petrol; I told him his flip up screen 
made his yellow Daytona look like a duck. 

I left to go home just before eight. The others hung on for a while then 
went
their separate ways. We just didn't know that one of those ways was about 
to end.



Cheers Paul

&gt;Bearing in mind earlier comments about the language of our initial

Too fuckin' right!
;-)

Do you remember Graham Chapman's (ISTR) funeral - the one from Python? When
Eric Idle closed it with "I'd like to be the last one to say 'cunt' at this
service?". That's the way I'd like to be remembered - loadsalaffs - but

 I don't post much these days but paul deserves a special mention.
 
 Like most people on Ixion, I 'met' Paul by way of an 'argument'.
 
 We soon had an off list banter going though and I knew he was a good 
 bloke, especially after Cadwell where we met with big smiles and a 
 handshake.
 
 Both he and Marvin were a good laugh at karting and it's a shame we won't 
 now see him at Cadwell.
 
 In a selfish way, at least now we're friends and he can watch out for me 
 at Oulton Park this weekend :-)
 
 Jeff/Marvin, I know it's extra pressure and don't feel obliged but myself 
 and I dare say others that knew him would be happy to donate anything for 
 a wreath or some tribute.

I know it's all been said before, but you know.... Like everyone else, I'm 
deeply saddened by the news about Paul. My sympathy goes out to Paul's 
family and to Sheridan - what she's going through doesn't bear thinking 
about. I don't know what happens after we're done here, but I think we can 
safely say that wherever Paul is now, he's still a loud, jovial, irreverent 
piss-taking git; and we wouldn't have had him any other way. I'll remember 
him best sitting in Squires one damp afternoon, downing endless cups of
tea,
trading tall stories and insults, and laughing a lot. Ride free, Paul - you 
will not be forgotten.

Having been digesting lately I was just catching up when I read this,

I was just settling down to catch up with the latest postings, and was
completely knocked flat by the tragic news about Paul.

What can I say? Like so many on the list, I felt that I knew Paul well,
although I only had the good fortune to meet him once, and then briefly. 

The sense of shock, emptiness and "why?" always seems acute when someone
you feel you know well dies in such tragic circumstances, especially one
so full of life as Paul.

Jeff, please pass on my deepest condolences to his family and
girlfriend.

What a time to come back to Ixion. I only knew Paul through email, but
he felt like a friend to me.

&gt;I now find myself staring out of the window at the bike and wondering
&gt;if it's worth it.

I know what you mean - I didn't want to take the bike to work today,
but I did, because otherwise I might never have got on one again. I
had the same thing 3 months ago, when a friend had an accident and his
pillion was killed. But, I've been rallying for 10 years, and I've
always said to Anna and my family - I don't want to die, but if I do
doing this, at least I went doing something I loved. I have a similar
attitude to bikes, and maybe Paul felt the same.

Sorry for rambling - my head's fucked up just now, between excitement
at getting my Fazer tomorrow (my first brand new bike) and shock at
Paul's death. The two emotions just don't go well together.

Just got back after the bank holiday, and spending yesterday on the

with him in making arrangements for Ixie does France. I was really
looking forward to meeting him, and spending a wild week in France, but
obviously I will not have that opportunity now.

of him and hold a minutes silence on Friday. My deepest sympathies to his

Fellow Ixies Be very careful out there this summer, I don't like to see
posts like that. I've noticed accidents happening with alarming
regularity to people on the list, myself, Nigel, Doc Sarah and many more.

Sorry about the wibble and swearing, I've just had too many friends have

I've just got back from a week-long trip on the bike ... I was just about
to say how good it felt to have ridden all around England and Wales, to
have bumped into Simon Batey by chance at his local bike shop (cheers
mate, for showing me the excellent roads down there), and so on

Then I read the news about Paul.
I'm stunned, don't know what to say.

I wasn't exactly a close friend but each time we met we had a good laugh
and a chat. On my way past Goole, to and from Cadwell or wherever, I would
call in to say hi.

Cannot say any more ... I have just sat here thinking, gobsmacked, until
the screensaver cut in and reminded me there's little point in typing
any more - I'm spending more time thinking sad sorry thoughts than typing.

Deepest sympathy to Sheridan and Paul's family.

Hi,
Just read the digest - what an awful, unexpected, shitty thing to happen.
Like some other ixies, I'd never met Paul but it's sickening all the same.

My heart goes out to Sheridan and his family who have got a hard period of
adjustment. They will probably need a lot of support, not just now or in
the next month, but over the next few years too.

Life can certainly deal some unexpected and shit hands of cards sometimes.

Best wishes,

I was a close friend of Paul's for 14 years, but had a "falling out" 18
months ago and had not seen him during that time. On Saturday the 16th
of May I was in Hull buying a new leather jacket. Paul came in while I
was still there and we talked for quite a while and promised to get back
in touch. He gave me his email address and details of Ixion. As I now
live in London and don't go to Hull very often, so I thank fate that I
met him again before that awful day.
I will be at the funeral on Friday with my brother and will hope to meet
some of you who have posted messages about Paul. At this moment I am too
upset to write much about him but will try to do some writing about him
in the near future (complete with pictures from some of our tours together).

Driving back from a vist to my parents in Durham last night, I passed the
sign for Sherbun from the A1. I smiled at the thought that there are people
I know in an area of the country I rarely visit. I thought about Paul and
the other Ixies in the Sherbun area last night whilst driving the A1. It was
a brief thought, and accompanied with a smile.

I've met Paul several times ... Seeing the message header amongst 200
messages from the list I opened up the thread first. The rest you know
because we've all felt it.

It's enough for me that I smiled last night on my way home. It's indicative
of the camaraderie and companionship this list offers. A testament to the
memory of a fine bloke that I'll hold with me each and everytime I pass that
sign on the A1.

In the interim forgive me while the smiles are mixed with tears.

I felt the same on Thursday evening. We were driving up to
Harrogate to see the SO's parents for the weekend when I too saw the
Sherburn sign and thought I know some ixies who meet there. Then on Sunday
we were out mountain biking in the North York Moors and stopped on the way
home at Helmsley to find the market square is the Box hill of the North,
only better. 60 or so Motorcyclists sat out in the sun, catching the rays,
drinking tea and eating fish and chips. And the route from Easingwold to
Helmsley looked the perfect road - twisty enough, wide enough and a decent
surface.

I, and I'm sure other ixies, have had the experience of riding along,
closing your eyes to blink ... and opening your eyes to find the road
replaced by hospital ceiling. Where did the road go? What happened in
those five minutes which I'll never remember?

I don't have any spiritual beliefs, but at times like this I hope I'm
wrong, and that Paul has just done one of those "long blinks". Who can
imagine the scene before him when he opens his eyes?

The experience of being knocked out has reassured me that, should I go
that way, I won't know anything about it. But it has also changed my
perspective, so that now I ride safe not for myself, but to spare
those who care about me the suffering which I know Paul's friends and
family are now enduring.

We should be consoled that Paul died riding, and without suffering.
A dozen people die every day on our roads - I keep checking the news
headlines, but they never mention it. All that matters, all that
remains of these lost souls is the bereavement, the grief, and the
happy memories living on in friends and family. The grief will fade in
time and the happy memories will remain, and that's the way it should
be.

The members of Ixion, even those like myself who didn't know Paul
well, are genuinely upset by this tragic event, because he was one of
us. The cameraderie of motorcyclists is as important to me as the
riding itself, and I'm proud to be 'one of us' too. It's at times like
this that friends really matter, and I hope it's some small comfort to
Paul's family to know that Paul had a lot of friends who will all miss
him.

Paul's friends and family are now suffering the most terrible pain of
all. We can all imagine the loss of a loved one: the imagined loss is
painful enough, yet I'm sure the reality is far worse still. I can
only extend my deepest sympathy at this awful time.

Everyone deals with grief in their own way, and my way is to indulge
in long, rambling and incoherent introspection. I hope no-one minds
too much.

Rest in peace Paul,

Adam.

My sympathies go humbly to Paul's closest.

Paul is really the first biker I've known to any extent to loose his
life doing what he loved and the news really shocked me. John
Greystrong's comment about wondering if it's really worth it strikes a
cord right now.

Maybe we all get complacent about the risks we take but none so much as
a newbie I guess. :0/ 

For my part I will miss Paul's sarcastic comments and comic attempts to
worry me about both our sexuality's! I'll also miss his bounding
enthusiasm for biking and touring, had I had a clue what part of the
world I'd be in this summer, I'd have been touring with Paul and Marvin
too. :0)

His presence will be missed in this strange new world, where geography,
status and a lot of other things that society deems essential, don't
matter and where intelligence, wit and good humour are all.

I do hope we go on to bigger and better things, I'd love to think Paul
is riding round free and happy now, in the sun with all of 'em gaggin'
for it! I guess I'll only know when I join him one day. :0)

Until then, farewell Paul! Hoping you're riding free!

I've only met Paul a handful of times, Ixion@Cadwell97 was the first time I
met Paul and was immediately struck by the warmth of the person under that gruff
Northern Ferret Fancier exterior.  I have many memories of Paul, either from
talking in person or by exchange of emails, but two main events stand out 
in my mind.

He and Jeff kept us all in stitches at IxionDoesMadTrax where they were at
it hammer and tongs on the track, Paul winning the award for
TheMostObviousFalseStarts of the day. Jeff had to resort to pushing him off
the track to win. It was all in good fun and Paul was always in the centre of
things, goading, taking the mickey, just having a laugh...enjoying life.

The other main memory I have of Paul is at the IxiDoesKarting event where
the Soft Southerners took on the Rufty-tufty Northerners. Jeff had volunteered
him into the NFF team without him knowing, but it didn't take much pursuasion
for him to come down to London to show us southerners a thing or two.

'cos I was organising, I didn't spent much socialising, but Paul took time
out thoughout the evening to pass the time of day with me, so I didn't feel too
left out.  :-)

Oh yes, he was also a contender for TheMostObviousFalseStart of the day
there too !
The Northerners won that event, but he was magnanimous in victory...NOT! But
that was just part of the gentle ribbing that always accompanied him
wherever he went.
I'd repeat what he said about the Southern Ixi team, but this is a
swear-free digest today :-)

I never made any EuroTours with him, but I read the reports avidly, with a
great grin on my face, envious of Paul and marvin's adventures in foreign
climes. I could almost have been there.  That's why so many of us on Ixion
who have never met him, or only met him a few times, feel we have lost a close
member of our community. We all share our experiences to such an extent,
that even though physically absent, we are there in spirit, sharing those
mountain twisties. Ixion will continue without Paul, but his spirit will remain with
Ixion.

Every time we did meet in the flesh however, we've had a reet good laugh.
Which I guess, is the best epitaph anyone can wish for.


Bye Paul.
I know you're enjoying yerself on a bike which'll never run out of petrol.
Pity it's a two-stroke ;-)

Kee Wei Turnbull

P.S. Live your life to the full, people, you only have one and only *you*
can live it. The past few days have made me realise that life is too short to be
miserable.
Paul I'm sure, would approve of these sentiments.

I've said this before, and I'll say it again.

Sorry to hear about the sad death of Paul. Though I never (knowingly) met   
him, he was one of the Spirits of Ixion with his stories and his banter,   
and its not pleasant to hear about such tragedies. My heart also goes out   
to those who did know him; family and friends alike. They are the ones   
who really have to cope with this loss.

Small solice, but at least he died doing what he enjoyed. Paul, I hope   
that the roads are better and emptier on the Other Side.

At the weekend, my granny received the news that her best friend for the 
past 51 years had died.  I couldn't find any appropriate words then either.

When I visited Sarah in hospital recently, it stunned me for days that what
takes a moment to do can have consequences that will last, in Sarah's case,
for many months.  In Paul's case, the consequences will last an eternity.

I love to ride and to drive, but the fear that someone could fail to spot me
or Adam as they glance at their map or fumble with their radio to hear the
traffic news, is never far away.  I used to ride without fear, but when I
realised how easy it would be to be robbed of my life or my happiness, I
stopped riding for years.  But not to ride is to rob oneself of life and
happiness.  I hope Paul's family can understand.

I'm glad to have known Paul, even slightly - he always made me laugh.  I'm
sorry I won't now be able to know him better.

I only met Paul once, but got to know him well though his contributions
to IXION.  

Only some one who follows a group such as IXION would know what I mean.

It was with great sadness I read of his death and wish to pass on my
condolences to his family and friends.

I never met Paul, so only knew him through his messages in here. And
although he was one of those people who you felt you knew, just by 
reading his messages, I'll let others who knew him better talk about him.

But if there are any of his family and friends who find themselves 
wishing he hadn't ridden a bike, perhaps an article I wrote after a close 
call of my own might say something of relevance.

I wasn't sure whether to post it, as you don't know how it might be 
interpreted by those who are suffering the anguish of such a senseless 
loss. But, having lost someone very close to me some years ago, I think I 
would have wanted to read it.

                                         **********

Life, Death and Motorcycles

I was knocked off my bike a year ago. At the time, it seemed a minor 
accident: a week or so on crutches and that would be that. This turned 
out not to be the case.

Unbeknown to me (and to the consultant supposedly treating me -- but 
that's another story), I developed a condition known as a DVT: 
blood-clots forming in the main veins. Left untreated, these clots tend 
to break up and make their way to the lungs, producing a pulmonary 
embolism. Pulmonary embolisms are usually fatal.

There are a number of things one shouldn't do if one wishes to avoid a 
DVT developing into a pulmonary embolism. Top of the list are lots of 
activity, and exposing yourself to the reduced pressure of a plane. I had 
no idea I had a DVT; I was keen to get off the crutches asap; and I was 
in the middle of a five-country project at work. I was thus extremely 
active, and went ahead with business trips to Germany and Singapore -- 
the latter a 13-hour flight each way.

In short, I should have died.

Several visitors to my hospital bed asked me if I was going to continue 
riding bikes after so close a call. It was a question I'd asked myself on 
the first day I found myself lying in a hospital bed with a hi-tech drip 
plugged into my arm. Weren't the risks too great? Didn't it make sense to 
protect oneself inside a concoon of steel? The risks *are* high. Biking 
is dangerous, and we must never forget it. If we want the safest way of 
getting from A-B, then the steel cage wins every time.

But having a close encounter of the grim reaper kind makes you stop and 
think. In particular, it makes you think about whether you would have had 
any regrets had your life ended at that point. Are you living the life 
you want to? Have you got your priorities right? Do you appreciate what's 
important in life and what's not?

To people who don't ride, the idea that biking can be one of the 
important things in life sounds odd. But it is. It's important because it 
cuts down on the amount of my life I waste sitting in traffic jams. It's 
important because chucking a bike around the lanes on a Sunday afternoon 
gives me a great deal of pleasure. But mostly it's important because 
riding a motorcycle -- like rock-climbing, or parachuting, or sailing or 
doing anything we love -- is *living*.

Helen Keller said that 'life is either a daring adventure or nothing.' 
What does this mean? Live for today and damn the consequences? Not to me: 
creating the kind of future we want for ourselves and for others is one 
of the most fulfilling adventures available. But it does mean that we 
need to decide what it is we want from life, and take action to get it.

Is this a licence to look after number one, to say 'sod everyone else, 
I'm taking what I want'? Only if what we want in life is to be the kind 
of person who lives like that.
Does it mean I'm going to jump on my bike and do 140mph down my favourite 
country lane? No, because I want to ride again tomorrow, and because 
there's no satisfaction in riding stupidly: the satisfaction comes from 
being in control of the bike, not merely holding onto it.

But it does mean that I'm not going to give up biking. That first time 
back in the saddle after a gap of two months was pretty frightening. But 
not nearly as frightening as failing to *live*.

To Friends and Family of Paul

I didn't really know Paul that well, except through our collective
interest and love for motorbikes. Words can't express the sorrow of losing
such a buoyant member of our little group of riders. He will be missed.
My sincerest condolencies to you all.

From: Ian Ellison

Like many other Ixies, I didn't meet Paul in the flesh but had several
exchanges with him through the list.

His premature death brings home to all of us how quickly and unexpectedly
these things can hit us. There are 2 consoling aspects to this; firstly the
fact that most of us live in blissful ignorance of how long we have to go,
and continue living life to the full to the end.

Secondly, from personal experience, in a near death situation when the
realisation hits you that this may be your last day on earth the prospect is
not all that bad - I experienced a sense of massive calm once I thought
there was nothing else I could do. The worst thing and what pulled me
through was the thought of how it would affect my wife and family. 

I hope that there is life after death, and in it you get  whatever you
desire - and if that's true, then I'm sure Paul is having a great time now
roaring round empty twisty roads on a big Triumph!

RIP Paul

Dear All,
	Just caught up with my mail @ work to find a week's worth of
condolences and wish to add mine. Paul was one of the first Ixies I 
ever met (on a Scarboro' trip last year) and was one of those I most 
admired - not just for his skill and experience but for his humour 
and for the way he made me feel a part of a group of people I'd only 
just met. Paul, wherever you are, the world is a smaller and duller 
place without you.

Jim.

So long...

         and thanks for all the fish !!!

I'm sure that Douglas Adams wouldn't understand, but am equally sure that 
most Ixies will :)

Paul is greatly missed by myself and all. It is perhaps a reflection on the
community of the list that this sad event has effected us all so much.

All my thought and condolences are with Paul's family and with Sheridan
today.

A very hard thing to lose a son, a freind a lover. I was never fortunate
enought to meet Paul in person - but through this medium, thought of him as
a friend.

As a musician, practising this morning, I played a lament for him, as a
motorcyclists, I went out for a whizz around in his memory.

All I can say is he died doing what he loved best,  the world is a poorer
place for his passing.

Safe Riding

"Any man's death diminishes me, for I am of mankind. Therefore, send not to
ask for whom the bell tolls: it tolls for thee."
[John Donne]

Donne was right. But we're closer to some bits of mankind than others.
We're all motorcyclists, and we're all Ixies.

That bell is tolling for us.
Pause, reflect and then get on with life.
But don't forget.

There ought to be an upbeat note at the end here. 
Hardly know what to put. 
At least it's a good day to lay a motorcyclist to rest: I think I'll go out
and worry the Michelin men on the edge of the tread.

Subject:          Paul II (not the Pope)

No, I can't sleep.

Thanks for posting PAMEA and Paul's research into the IAM. It's one of
the best things I've read on Ixion, and I now remember it caused my
longest conversation with him: I emailed him with "Excellent! :-)" and
he mailed back with "Thanks!" (or word to that effect).

Amanda went through her mail folders and found a conversation she'd
had with him too. I'd forgotten how witty he was.

I think it's weird, and a very special aspect of the list, that Paul's
postings and messages are still in Ixion archives and mail folders on
dozens of discs around the country. Reminds me a bit of a short story
I read where a telepathic community didn't get sad when people died
because the group consciousness took on the good bits of the departed
personality.

Some darker thoughts ...

I think it was a bit Diana-oid last week, with everyone rushing to
mail "I didn't know him but I'm sad too" messages, like politicians
not wanting to seem callous and uncaring but instead sounding
impersonal and insincere. The postings in #1168 were good though.
Hey - I thought it was No Swearing Day?

Was it only me who wondered about the reaction if it'd been me instead
of Paul? Who would've been sad; what would've been said; what old
posts would've been regurgitated; who would've come to the funeral?

Was it only me who felt cheated that it wasn't a dozy car driver
pulling out in front of him? Someone who we could've got properly
angry with and had a good blame-fest?

<h2>Paul Yull's funeral</h2>

<h3>Written by Jim Gillespie, posted by Jeff Wain</h3>

<p>
People started to gather at Wain Manor on Thursday.  I think Jeremy Sagar
was first to arrive, sometime in the afternoon, followed in some order by
marvin, Flossie, Mike and Dee Fleming, and lastly Mik and Mel Reed and
myself at just about midnight, as estimated in spite of setting off an hour
late (which was apparently Mik's fault, but we won't go into that).  Mike F
had sacrificially dropped his bike (the Daytona 900) before our arrival, to
appease Ixion.  Our journey up was uneventful, having missed most of the
traffic...
</p>

<p>
Everyone piled out of the house to help the three of us squeeze our bikes
into the last crevices of Jeff's capacious garage, and then we settled down
with several bottles of wine and beer before going to bed at various hours
(Dee, marvin and I went to our (separate) beds at about 0430, just as Sol
was getting out of his).
</p>

<p>
Mel woke me with a cup of tea at 0730 and I slowly started to crawl out of
my pit as Richard the Gerald the Moore, Jane, Simes Atkinson, and Sol
arrived.  Dominic ?Klein? also showed up at some point, and after less than
the usual amount of fiddling we all set off in convoy except for Flossie,
who set off in his borrowed Volvo.  After a petrol stop the journey to Hull
was quiet except for one tailgater and trying to find the crematorium; Jeff
managed to fit in the traditional U-turn and then we stood outside the wrong
chapel for a few minutes until someone realised the mistake and we hastily
recovered our kit from Flossie's car (except one or two die-hard anti-helmet
types) and moved next door to the larger chapel.
</p>

<p>
There was a large turnout, about sixty of Paul's family and thirty or so
friends including the Ixies.  I was doing alright until I saw the hearse
with Paul's coffin.  I think it was then that I realised that he was in that
wooden box and that I'd never see him again; never watch him vanish
effortlessly into the distance as I struggled to keep up; never have him
stop unexpectedly for a fag or a cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
The service concentrated mainly on Paul's love of life, family and friends,
bikes, football and animals - there was supposed to be a collection
afterwards for the RSPCA but nobody seemed to be collecting.  It was quite a
short service, with one hymn, "Thine Be The Glory".  I wondered if whoever
chose it noticed the phrase "sing a hymn of triumph"; the reference made me
smile on one of the most miserable days I can remember.  I don't know about
the others, but I felt that the service made me feel a bit better; it gave a
sort of official end to the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
After the service we weren't sure if a horde of bikers would be appreciated
at Paul's parents' house, but apparently his father practically insisted on
us going and we followed someone to the house.  By the time we arrived the
morning drizzle was completely gone and the sun was coming out.  And Veggie
Dave had appeared from somewhere, having spent the last couple of hours
exploring Humberside.
</p>

<p>
Beer, tea and soft drinks were distributed, and Paul's mother (I think)
encouraged us to eat the food she'd prepared.  We talked of this and that
before taking our leave and going our separate ways, most of which came
straight back here to Wain Manor to collect our luggage and Jeff
commissioned me (for a  glass of Ribena) to write this report.
</p>

<p>
Cheers Paul, wherever you are.
