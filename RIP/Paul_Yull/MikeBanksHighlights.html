<H1 align=center>Paul Yull - Some highlights of a Friendship</H1>

<h2>From: Mike Banks</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Meeting Paul on at College in 1982. He had Bennelli 654, I had Soozie
    X5. First made impression on him
    by passing him on the inside into a roundabout (I was going to fast)
  </li>
  <li>
    His falling off the Bennelli in the College car park whilst cornering
    for me to take a photo of how far he was leaning over. Unfortunately I
    didn't even get the picture!
  </li>
  <li>
    Getting from Hull to Brid in 35 mins at night instead of doing QM at
    college. Me hanging off the CX500 to keep
    up with him.
  </li>
  <li>
    Him hanging from his then girlfriend's bedroom window telling me to sod
off one night when I had piled the CX,
not realising that's what I had done.
  </li>
  <li>
    His Russian Rega moped.
  </li>
  <li>
    The succession of crap cars including 2 Reliant Regal vans and a Citroen
Diane.
  </li>
  <li>
    The mystery tour that ended up on the Isle of Wight - and my first try
of a joint!
  </li>
  <li>
    The flames from the exhaust of his Ducati Darhma on over-run.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trashing of both sides of the fairing of the GSXR1100  on one
v.windy night.
  </li>
  <li>
    Chasing him all over the Cotswolds on Sunday Runs. He could always pick
a good route - I still can't.
  </li>
  <li>
    My first trip to Europe when he was working in Brussels. Hit the City
at rush hour. , then 6 countries
in 7 days.
  </li>
  <li>
    Chasing his XBR 500 through the Pyrenees on my CB750F - that thing
could shift.
  </li>
  <li>
    The matching Ex army Can Am Bombardiers we had and the fun trail riding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Him letting me ride The LeMans Mk 3 - I could not walk after 40 miles -
but was hooked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Buying the MK4 lemon on his say so, nearly smashing it into the front
of a Merc, 20 mins later
trying to keep up with him in his Fiat X19 (he was 4 wheel drifting it).
But the best thing he did for me.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meeting his g/f Sherridan for the first time and thinking it was about
time he went out with someone
shorter than him.
  </li>
  <li>
    The only holiday we took together that did not involve bikes - Canal
Barge in Republic of Ireland.
  </li>
  <li>
    Him falling off his BMW on Cow Shit!
  </li>
  <li>
    Seeing him trying to get both feet down on the Dominator.
  </li>
  <li>
    Doom sessions.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
He was a good friend and I could go on and on but that would be boring.
Which he would say I always do,
so good bye Paul, I will miss you.
</p>

<p>
Mike.
