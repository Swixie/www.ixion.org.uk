Just read this on the Electronic Telegraph:

AN experienced parachutist who recently learned to "skysurf" fell to his death
when his snowboard became entangled in his emergency parachute in a 15,000ft
jump.

Fellow parachutists at Headcorn aerodrome, Kent, yesterday spoke of their
horror as they saw 36-year-old Nigel Thomas spiralling down and trying to
disentangle himself after his main parachute failed to open.

[...]

RIP

Nigel had subscribed to Ogri/Ixion in the early days of the list and was known and liked by many.
Our deepest sympathy to Victoria and to the rest of Nigel's family.

<h2 align=center><font color=black>Paul Yull</font></h2>

<p align=center>
<p>
Paul died doing something we all love, riding his motorcycle.
He was a well respected member of Ixion, with many noticable postings and
trip reports, as well as the author of an excellent guide to motorcycle touring:

Some of his exploits were reported in:
<a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~kmbennett/alps97/index.htm">Paul and Marvin's Excellent
Adventure</a>.

<p>
His funeral was
held on Friday 29 May 1998 at 10:20.
As a gesture of respect, only mail dedicated to the memory of Paul was allowed
through Ixion between 10:00 and 14:00.
