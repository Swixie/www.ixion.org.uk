<H1 align=center>Posting Etiquette</H1>

The Johnathan Jeffries guide to Mailing List Etiquette.

<HR>

The obvious overall goal is for other people to understand what you
said/meant:

<OL>
  <LI>It is particularly helpful if you put your message in some sort of
      context.  This particularly true if you are responding to someone else's
      comments.  Usually it is easy enough to copy the original's meaning to
      your own posting.
  <LI>At the same time it is considered irritating - i.e. not polite - to
      just enclose the whole damn previous message - which everyone else
      including the originator - will have seen resent billyuns and billyuns
      of times.  A little creative editing makes reading your message much
      more pleasant and therefore much more likely to be received with an open
      mind.
  <LI>Attribution:  most of us like to know who we are talking to.  Just
      like with the regular post if you don't sign your letters we may be able
      to decipher enough from the post mark to make an educated guess as to
      where the letter originated.  But it's still nice to see that the writer
      thinks enough of their own work/thoughts to sign his/her name to them.  
      Some mail environments will automatically add your sig file to the
      posting.  But I've found that a lot of folk don't know a sig file from a
      kill file.
  <LI>Also when you are responding to someone else's comments/posting etc
      you really ought to acknowledge that that person said that.  Usually by
      copying the person's name, address etc.  But <b>BEWARE</b> of false
      attributions.  This can really irritate other people and lead to those
      nasty flame wars that Papa Joe so wants to avoid.
  <LI>And then there are all the little nuances like not using CAPITALS
      unless you want to emphasize something.  And the fact that some mail
      environments have a difficult time with lines over 80 characters long
      suggests that we should try to limit lines to 60-70 characters.  (mea
      culpa for my failures in this area).
  <LI>Lastly, politeness always helps.  If you are interested in spelling
      contests, flame wars or panty raids  you will probably be better off in
      wreck.moto.  There's a motorcycle gang over there which delights in
      seeing how much band width they can occupy with such.  &lt;Actually I am
      DoD but on good behaviour>.
</OL>
