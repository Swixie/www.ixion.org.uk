<H2>What's going on 'ere, then?</H2>
Well, to put it simply, the subscribers to the
<A HREF="/">Ixion</A> motorcycle mailing list have got such
hectic lives, and organise so much stuff, that everyone was having trouble
keeping track of WTF was supposed to be happening, and when.
<BR>That may all change now that there is
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/calendar/calendar.pl">a resource</A>
at which all and sundry may point their browsers and get the low down on the
high life of the list.

<H2>New, improved calendar.</H2>
<BR>The
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/calendar/calendar.pl">ixion calendar</A>
is a live online thing, so you'll be able to see your entry immediately.
<BR><B>Take care</B> because there is no facility for an
individual to delete an incorrect entry. If you get it wrong, mail the
<A HREF="/perl/mm?t=1">calendarmaster</A>
who will sort it out.
<BR>If you need to put a link into the calendar, write the
link using HTML tags in your entry.

<H2>How do I get an event listed?</H2>
At the bottom of each month is a form for you to add your entry.
