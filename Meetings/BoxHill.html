<h2><a name="history">A Brief History</a></h2>

Box Hill is a picturesque place situated just north of the Surrey town of Dorking
and in the midst of the North Downs.  It has views over the Surrey/Sussex
Weald.  The village of Mickleham lies under the east side of the hill, with the village
of Headley in the downs to the north west.  The river Mole flows through Dorking past
Mickleham to the town of Leatherhead, in the north, and then to the Thames at
Hampton Court.  The Mole Valley provides a route through the North Downs (A24), none
of which are particularly high even by English standards, although the south side
is rather steep making them difficult to pass with horse drawn vehicles.

<p>It has been a Sunday morning gathering place for motorcyclists in the
south of England for many years.  Dumpies Rusty Nuts (a cult UK "rock" band)
even recorded a song "Box Hill or Bust".

<p>I can remember seeing members of the 59
club on their regular run out of London in the seventies.  At first the meetings
were up the top of the hill, in what is now the Natural Trust car park.
Some would race up and down the <strong>very</strong> twisty road from the
bottom car park (where we now meet) to the top and visa versa.
After several fatalites speed humps (sleeping policemen) were placed in the road and
the National Trust started charging for the car parks and discouraging motorcyclists.
Shame really, they must have lost out on the profits from the Cafe.

<p>In the bottom car park, a caravan (US trailer) started selling coffee and burgers
under the name "Rykers". Over the years they expanded this until it caught fire in the
early eighties.  Fortunatly they were able to persuade the local council to let them
build a permenant Cafe next to the bottom car park.

<p>As the road leading up the hill from Mickleham became  less usable (it
is now one way) more and motorcyclists started using the main road from Dorking
to Leatherhead that runs underneath the hill. This is a fast road with two lanes
each way, and several wide sweeping bends suitable for very high speeds.  Unfortunalty
the footpath crosses the road several times, at least twice round the blind side
of a bend!  This has lead to several pedestrians being run down.
Also a sharp dip in the road combined with an adverse camber after the
second southbound bend has lead to a number of accedents - mostly cars flipping over!
Due to this, the south bound carrageway is now single lane with a 40mph speed limit.

<H2><a name="directions">How to get to Box Hill</a></H2>

Here are instructions for finding Box Hill (care of Adrian Adams).
Though this might originally have been Roger Fords
directions <IMG SRC="/Icons/smiley.gif"  WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALT=":)">.

<p>For anyone who has not been to Boxhill, it is very easy to find.
Head out of town on the A24 (junction 9 on the M25) heading for Dorking.

<P>After the Leatherhead bypass (which is not particularly noticable as
such) the road becomes single lane - the spoilsports have striped off
one lane to slow the traffic through the "deceptives".  Shortly after
this finishes there is a car park on the left, just before the Boxhill
roundabout.  Unless you're blind or it's raining, you can't miss the
huge number of bikes. Sometimes you can go straight into the car park,
sometimes that entry is closed and you have to go in the back way by
turning left at the roundabout.  Watch out for the officious git in the
white coat telling you where you can't park. Ryka's is right next to the
car park and cannot be missed.

<P>If you find yourself in Dorking, you've gone too far.

<P>From the A25, you need to go into Dorking, and take a right at the
first roundabout, A24 signposted Leatherhead.  You are then approaching
Boxhill from the other side.  Do a right at the second roundabout (I
think). Should be pretty obvious.

<h2><a name="where">How to find an Ixionite</a></h2>

We normally meet at the nearest table to the Cafe, unless it's cold, when
we meet in the Cafe <img src="/Icons/smiley.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" alt=":)">.

<p>However, unless you can recognise someone from a picture you have found
on the net, you have the 'fun' task of going round the tables and asking.
