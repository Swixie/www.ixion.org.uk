<h1 align=center>Tidy potato story so far<h1>

<p align=right><em>By Richard Moore</em></p>

<p>     
Jase said, rashly, "I swear I heard something there... 
&lt;looks around&gt; nah! must be a figment of my imagination" 
</p>

<h2>squish</h2>
     
<p>
He hears a splintering and creaking, turns round to see 
door jambs disintegrate as 8 foot slavering killer 
hamster in studded leather crashes ponderously through, 
menacingly swinging a Genuine (TM) Harley Davidson (R) 
Soap-on-a-rope (in a sock).
</p>

<p>
After a momentary mixture of fear (you don't often see 
8ft killer hamsters) and disbelief (well not in HD 
studded leather jock straps anyway) flashing through his 
mind he looks to the cages stacked against the walls and 
cries "up and at him my furry army" as the multitude of 
small white mice swarm his nemesis, Captain Potato, Jase 
dives from the house, past his alter egos car (parked 
neatly up a street light) and jumps on his trusty 
Bavarian steed. But will it outrun Captain Potato's pile 
of Milwaulkee iron...? 
</p>

<p>
Brushing mice from his nemesis and striding to the rail 
here his steed was tethered, Captain Potato-Hamster 
thrust his soap-on-a- rope into its holster alongside 
the petrol tanks and kicked the beast into  life. As the 
bike leaped rhythmically up and down around the pistons 
he engaged first with a clang. 
</p>

<p>
Hurtling up the dusty street with the onrush of a steam 
train, at 2 thousand throbbing revs in pursuit of a 
sweating Jase on a small, bendy bring-ding-dinging 
thing, his vision was suddenly obscured as a large cat 
that had been asleep in the tool roll leaped up 
and struck him upside down in the face, digging its 
claws into his ears...
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jase seeing Captain Potato-hampster in dire 
trouble starts to make good his escape, each corner 
acompanied by the scraping sound as he grinds his 
flat-twin's heads into the tarmac. Coming round a fast 
right-hander disaster strikes!  The continual scraping 
on the heads has worn them down too far and now his 
steed starts streaming oil though a holed 
rocker-cover...
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile back with Captain Potato-Hampster......
</p>

<p>
...meanwhile indeed, Jase's bike has transformed itself 
once more, Dr Who style, into an MZ, and as Captain 
Potato wobbles wildly and blindly round the corner Jase 
begins his kickwhumphohbuggeritsahighcompressionbloodyMZ 
bloodyengineandIgotitwrongbloodyOW" traditional leaping 
and hopping dance. The cat, startled and still upside 
down, pisses into our (well, my) hero's mouth, but being 
brought up on a diet of Australia's finest he barely 
notices. The mighty iron thing continues straight as a 
die into the nearest field, startling a pair of scoobys 
fondling each other ineptly in a furrow.
</p>

<p>
Captain potato-hamsters Mighty Steed continues across 
the field (plowing a *perfect* furrow as it does so) 
through another hedge, straight across a road through a 
parked c*r and onto a side road, arms straining from the 
effort the Captain finally brings his American 
juganaught down from the giddy hights of 20mph to a 
standstill.
Able now to take his hands off the bars (he was worried 
earlier they might vibrate off if he took his hands 
way) he pry's the cats claws from his face before he can 
finally remove the cat (and some rather large pieces of 
skin). Captain Potato-Hamster turns his 5 ton bike round 
with nothing more than a 24point turn, one panic and a 
near spill. Kicking his Trac^H^H^H^Hmighty steed into 
1st he sets off again in lukewarm pursuit of jase...
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile with nothing more than a fractured shin Jase 
has finaly managed to start his high performance 
machine...
</p>

<p>
...a fearful chimaera, fused obscenely by some 
automotive Dr Moreau from the shuddering corpses of an 
MZ, an MZ an MZ and, er, 6 other MZs.
</p>

<p>
Still shuddering from the previous writer's erratic 
transatlantic orthography, he shot horizontally round 
the corner past the gunshop in the sleepy western town, 
and unable to avoid the saloon in front of him he 
crashed through the wooden boarding next to the 
traditional swinging doors, slid across the floor and 
came to rest in a crumpled heap against the bar, AT 
WHICH A NUMBER OF CHARACTERS WERE DRINKING
</p>

<p>
&lt;PROMPT!&gt;
</p>

<p>
Bedecked in designer Italian Cowboy wear, 'Slim' Gene 
Rankin, and Elly(son) The Kid, turned from their grappa, 
and stared at the apparition on the sawdust and spit 
covered floor. The journey through the splintered wooden 
doors had removed various pieces of Jase's anatomy, one 
piece of which had landed in Slim's drink. Elly The Kid 
hissed through gritted teeth "This here's Doocativille, 
Hawg boy, you got no business in this goddam bar". He 
raised a bleeding stump, and pointed at Slim's drink 
"Ah've come fer ma Paw"
</p>

<p>
Hey bud drawled the kid "this ain't no Hawg, this is one 
of them there kraut bikes". "Nah" slurred Slim, "this 
here's seven of them there kraut bikes". At this moment 
Hoss Lowe rumbled out of the jon, "what we got here 
boys?" They looked up and out at him, "what we got here, 
is one of them Gebhardt posse. Silence reigned, plot 
rushed in.
</p>

<p>
Mad Corn Dog Dave appeared at the top of the stairs a 
glint in his eye.  "Not that there Gebhardt posse which 
has been buying up all the failing farms, pollutin' the 
water supply, Fiddlin with the wimmin at Kat's high 
class joint and eatin' all the pies?"
"Yup"
"Wait, hear that noise, it's the Gebhardt posse, it's 
showdown time..."
</p>

<p>
No it isn't, it's Captain Potato a-rumbling and a-riding 
through the swing doors, pointing his fingers at Mad 
Corn Dog Dave and drawling "Pow, pow, pow. Ppttwanng. 
You can't hit me, I'm invisible. I'm invisible." 
</p>

from the shower&gt;
