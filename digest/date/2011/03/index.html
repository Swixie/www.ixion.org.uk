	I heard there was a cable break which affected the Slough 21CN node.

Wonder if some pastry-encased meat unlockers were nicking copper?

My PC came back online OK but Bev's PC was fixated on the BT Wholesale

I know some people were dismissive of their attempts at smelting iron,
but I actually liked the fact that they had a proper go at it without
the <Blue Peter> here's one we made earlier</bp> cop out and
demonstrated that it's actually bloody difficult to do, which actually

Mark, our manic mechanic when we raced mopeds, had all sorts of
problems WRT his nationality/passport as for some reason he was born
aboard a Royal Navy ship anchored in the Grand Harbour in Valletta and
some muppet didn't do the correct paperwork at the time.
