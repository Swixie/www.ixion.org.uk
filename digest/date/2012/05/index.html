&gt; It's not very flexible, true. CompizConfig and Confity help on Ubuntu<br >
&gt; 11.x; I've not extensively tweaked 12.04 yet as the main thing I<br >
&gt; wanted - a smaller Launcher - is now right there in the preferences.<br >
&gt; There is MyUnity and UbuntuTweak for 12.x, which may help you.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; Actually IMO ubuntu took a major step back after 11.04 wrt multi-head.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Odd - works fine for me, on both identical&amp;  differing twin screens.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; IMO Windows handles multiple screens better than Linux now. :-(<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Win7 is not notably better or worse, IME, than before. It works<br >
&gt; acceptably. Shame it can't handle a vertical taskbar well.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; I wasn't a big fan of gnome previously but once KDE *also* broke<br >
&gt;&gt; multiple screens handling I strayed and have stayed now on 2.32 for a<br >
&gt;&gt; year...<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Try the Mat&eacute; desktop then. Built-in option on Mint 13, looks and works<br >
&gt; just like GNOME 2. I am not sure how much of a future it has got,<br >
&gt; though.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; [1] Plus I'm slightly sick of the MacOS loving on the minimise/maximise/close.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; [Shrug] It was an annoyance for all of 5-10 min for me, then I got<br >
&gt; used to it. You can move 'em back if you want. Mint does.<br >

It's just that every OS sucks... and blows.<br >

Now there's lih-nux or lie-nux,<br >
I don't know how you say it,<br >
or how you install it, or use it, or play it,<br >
or where you download it, or what programs run,<br >
but lih-nux, or lie-nux, don't look like much fun.<br >
<br >
However you say it, it's getting great press,<br >
though how it survives is anyone's guess,<br >
If you ask me, it's a great big mess,<br >
for elitist, nerdy shmucks.<br >
<br >
&quot;It's free!&quot; they say, if you can get it to run,<br >
the Geeks say, &quot;Hey, that's half the fun!&quot;<br >
Yeah, but I got a girlfriend, and things to get done,<br >
the Linux OS SUCKS.<br >
(I'm sorry to say it, but it does.)<br >

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diversity is disappearing. User interfaces are being dumbed-down into<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uselessness, while at the same time, OSs and apps are growing huger<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and huger, meaning not only sloth but growing difficulty in<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; troubleshooting their multiplying problems.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't hate everything new. I was very suspicious indeed of Android<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when I came to it as a happy Psion EPOC and Symbian user for about 15=<br >
y<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - but Android won me over before I left the shop and I was delighted<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with it.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been using Ubuntu as my main OS since it was first released an=<br >
d<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am delighted with the new Unity desktop, which became the default<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; last year - I find it a more pleasant experience than the older GNOME<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 desktop, although hundreds of people are complaining bitterly about<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the change all over the Web.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bah, I hate it.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry to hear that.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mostly because it really really does not play nice with multiple<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; screens<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; Odd. I am trying this on the left-hand screen of a dual-head machine<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; running Unity and it's as sweet as a nut. It duplicates the top panel<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; across both monitors, so I have 2 separate menu bars if there are<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; different apps open on both screens (Firefox on the left, Chrome on<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; the right, at the moment) - something that Mac OS X cannot do.<br >
&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; It doesn't work with multiple X sessions<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Aaaaah. I did not know that but I can imagine. I have tried multiple X<br >
&gt; sessions, once, years ago, on my NT4 PC. I got it working but couldn't<br >
&gt; see any point nor any conceivable use, for me.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; the reason for multiple X<br >
&gt;&gt; sessions is that fullscreen of remote desktops/VM's doesn't work with<br >
&gt;&gt; spanned.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; I've used 2-3 VMs at once on multihead, no problem. I don't use<br >
&gt; rdesktop much but I can move it from screen to screen or banish it<br >
&gt; onto a virtual desktop. What's the problem? (Just curious - not saying<br >
&gt; there isn't one.)<br >
<br >
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz/+bug/418209<br >
<br >
Logged 2009-08-24!<br >
<br >
&gt;&gt; The main reason it fails is that Compiz was changed in 11.10<br >
&gt;&gt; to only work on one screen so the second screen er fails. There is a<br >
&gt;&gt; work round of starting multiple Compiz processes for the multiple<br >
&gt;&gt; screens but it's messy.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Compiz is a bit of a POS, I believe (even its author says so:<br >
&gt; http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2011/12/25/apology-2/ ), and it's a<br >
&gt; major weakness of Ubuntu that Unity relies on it. They should have<br >
&gt; switched to Mutter but it would be a big rewrite: Unity is a Compiz<br >
&gt; plugin, I believe.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Have you tried with Unity-2D?<br >
<br >
No. I *like* the effects, if nothing else it makes everyone go &quot;wow&quot;<br >
when I rotate the desktop cube and you can see video playing and/or<br >
things updating - reversed and at an angle the other side of the cube.<br >
:-)<br >
<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; I get one launcher, on the left-hand screen, where it works best -<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; that's where I put OS X's Dock as well. In Precise, having 2 Launchers<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; is an option, albeit one I don't want.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't see any way it works less well than GNOME 2 did, frankly. It's<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; a /lot/ better than GNOME 3 on twin monitors, because G3 Shell just<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; ignores the right-hand screen; it gets a non-functional panel wasting<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; space, but it doesn't even do something sensible like put the<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; virtual-desktop switcher over there. It's a mess.<br >
&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; Lets not go there.<br >

&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but after lots of playing with it on my laptop I just cannot<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get on with the way the buttons and sliders are=A0inconsistent[1]<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please explain? I am not noticing this.<br >
&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; The way the sliders 'appear' and move around<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Do you mean scrollbar thumbs? If so, yes, the skinny scrollbars and<br >
&gt; on-again-off-again thumbs are a PITA, yes, but such a small one I've<br >
&gt; never bothered to turn 'em off. I believe you can, quite simply.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; the way the<br >
&gt;&gt; close/minimise/maximise are in the top bar.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Seems like an elegant space-saving move to me.<br >
<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; its so painful to configure (or just plain cannot be).<br >

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's not very flexible, true. CompizConfig and Confity help on Ubuntu<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; 11.x; I've not extensively tweaked 12.04 yet as the main thing I<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted - a smaller Launcher - is now right there in the preferences.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; There is MyUnity and UbuntuTweak for 12.x, which may help you.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually IMO ubuntu took a major step back after 11.04 wrt multi-head.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; Odd - works fine for me, on both identical &amp; differing twin screens.<br >
&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; It's ok for clone and ok for span, not OK for multiple X<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; [Nod] I believe you.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IMO Windows handles multiple screens better than Linux now. :-(<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; Win7 is not notably better or worse, IME, than before. It works<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; acceptably. Shame it can't handle a vertical taskbar well.<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I wasn't a big fan of gnome previously but once KDE *also* broke<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple screens handling I strayed and have stayed now on 2.32 for a<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; year...<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; Try the Mat=E9 desktop then. Built-in option on Mint 13, looks and work=<br >
s<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; just like GNOME 2. I am not sure how much of a future it has got,<br >
&gt;&gt;&gt; though.<br >
&gt;&gt;<br >
&gt;&gt; I intend to, bit of a big job to swap OS on my work machine though<br >
&gt;&gt; hence stuck with 11.04<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Ah, yes. Backup then in-place upgrade to 11.10 and thence 12.04?<br >
<br >
Yes, trouble is I need to ensure multi-head multi-gpu (4 screens, two<br >
video cards) works properly. I have recently acquired an identical<br >
machine though so after nicking one of the processors (so I now have 8<br >
cores bwahahaha) so I can stick in one of the drives from it and do a<br >
fresh install and see how it goes, if it doesn't work forget it or try<br >
another distro.<br >
<br >
&gt; If you planned ahead and have /home on a separate partition, then wipe<br >
&gt; &amp; reload is not too bad - all your settings and preferences are safe,<br >
&gt; you just need to reinstall any extra apps you've added.<br >
<br >
I have it all backed up to tape. :-)<br >

&gt; I can't find fault with any of that. I just find the trend towards<br >

&lt;hmmm, after speaking well of google thingies up there, I'm now using the<br >
gmail webinterface and wondering how this will format...&gt;<br >

actually, for me, as a networking bod, it's pretty interesting - certainly<br >
more fun than the gold-rush mentality of the early 2000s where the plan<br >
seemed to be to just throw as much fibre in the ground as possible and hope<br >
for the best. Now, it's all about trying to make the best of the<br >
infrastructure that's already there, so there's a lot more emphasis on<br >
traffic engineering, application specific acceleration, and performance<br >

happier developing and deploying custom networks on MPLS and data centres<br >
using a bit of nous rather than just connecting another &lt;n&gt; routers to<br >
AS&lt;n&gt; for $CORPORATION.<br >

For me, as a consumer, it's also all good. OK, I'm typing this email on a<br >
Win7 laptop (ta J!) which I love to bits, but that's only 'cos I happen to<br >

in my shed, I'd use either my RPi or a Linux desktop. If I was, I don't<br >
know, half-way up L'Arete Ouest in the Gorge de la Jonte, I'd use my phone.<br >
I am now completely platform and location independent, and can still post<br >
shite to Ixion. Really, it's exciting times. And it's only going to get<br >
better.<br >
