	Driving home I noticed a transit minibus overtake a small car. I thought <br >
to myself that the van looks well lit up by the car. Then another car <br >
came the other way and the small car dipped their lights...ah...lets <br >
see. Yup he put his main beam back on while the minibus was still only 2 <br >
car lengths in front. So the small car got a dose of my main beam + spot <br >
lamps. They turned off their main. I do fsking hate twits who put main <br >
beam on after you overtake...it makes it so much harder to get out of <br >
the way.<br >
