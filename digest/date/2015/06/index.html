	<p class="authorDate">Posted by Richard Purdie &lt;rpurdie-at-rpsys.net&gt; on 30 June 2015 | <a href="/digest/0.95390600 1435707909/#PageComments_holder" title="View Comments Posted">0 Comments</a></p>
	
	Inspired by Mikes tales of oil changing, I thought I'd mention the<br >
conclusion to the clutch dilemma.<br >
<br >
I bought a new clutch basket, somewhat hampered by people advertising<br >
things they didn't have stock of.<br >
<br >
It arrived and I read the instructions &quot;press out the centre of the<br >
original clutch basket&quot;, then realised you need a hydraulic press for<br >
this. Being determined to marshal this weekend, one was duly obtained<br >
(I've a crankshaft to rebuild too sometime etc.).<br >
<br >
This turned out to be a Haynes book of lies style instruction.<br >
Attempting to press out the centre, the pressure went to several tons,<br >
then the aluminium basket shattered with a noise that leaves me shaking<br >
thinking about it even now. Except around the boss of course which<br >
stayed intact. There wasn't enough left to deploy the press onto so<br >
saws, dremel and then a drift and hammer were ultimately deployed<br >
successfully. Drilling and punching out the rivets worked out in a more<br >
straight forward way to get the backplate/ring gear off.<br >
<br >
Pressing the boss into the new basket was also straightforward, even if<br >
my press gauge appears to give half the pressures in the instructions<br >
(or I've messed up).<br >
<br >
I'd previously put the carb in an ultrasonic cleaner and tried to blow<br >
the dents out the exhaust expansion pipe, with some but not complete<br >
success as the dents were all on welded seams. Those parts were duly<br >
refitted along with the new Rekluse clutch.<br >
<br >
Standing with the oil filled reassambled bike I realised a clutch plate<br >
was left over. I was pretty sure this was ok but ended up taking the<br >
cover off again to check. You can do this with the bike on its side<br >
without draining the oil but afterwards there was thick black treacle<br >
style oil coming from somewhere, turned out to be the powervalves drain<br >
pipe which I'm less worried about.<br >
<br >
Upon reassambly I even remembered to unblock the gearbox oil breather<br >
pipe since the gearbox was at vacuum when I disassembled it<br >
(incidentally connecting an airline to clear such a pipe makes a right<br >
mess).<br >
<br >
The automatic clutch is just plain weird but I think I'll grow to like<br >
it, it also proved the idle on the bike was simply too low. It all seems<br >
to roughly work, I've followed in the &quot;break in&quot; procedure in the<br >
manual, much to the undoubted delight of the neighbours. I've therefore<br >
committed to marshal the enduro at the weekend so we'll see what that<br >
brings.<br >
<br >
For some reason I read a post about Patrick's first race at Cadwell a<br >
couple of days ago and it brought back memories of my first trackday and<br >
how nervous I was. Its a good job Ixion-at-Cadwell is two day as otherwise<br >
I suspect I'd never have taken a bike on a track again. I got over those<br >
nerves, I also got over the nerves of marshalling in general (e.g<br >
Kielder rallies), I'm still apprehensive about the enduro though. Going<br >
outside your comfort zone is probably good once in a while...<br >
<br >
Of course the hydraulic press turned out to be incontinent and there was<br >
oil all over the place this morning. I've obtained a replacement pump so<br >
am hoping that sorts that. Nothing ever seems quite 100%<br >
straightforward.<br >
<br >
Cheers,<br >
<br >
Richard

	<p class="authorDate">Posted by mike &lt;mylovelyhorse-at-gmail.com&gt; on 30 June 2015 | <a href="/digest/0.29061200 1435702503/#PageComments_holder" title="View Comments Posted">0 Comments</a></p>
	
	On the way into work this morning I purchased an oil filter, 4 litres of<br >
15W40 and an air filter for the GS. This evening when I got home from work<br >
the bike got its 42,000 mile service only 450 miles or so late.<br >
<br >
The air filter was remarkably easy to change - earlier model years<br >
requiring a fair enough of bodywork removing, but for mine it's one central<br >
panel off (6 bolts) and then 4 retaining screws to reveal the filter. It<br >
was rather cleaner looking than I expected so I kept it for just in case.<br >
<br >
The oil drain is on the side of the engine so after I'd removed the belly<br >
pan (2 bolts and 4 nuts) I drained the engine. The oil filter was a little<br >
harder to get off as the belly pan mounting point stopped me getting a<br >
filter remover (like a huge socket) on it. I resorted to putting a<br >
screwdriver through it and twisting it off that way.<br >
<br >
At roughly this point the Weather decided to intervene and there was a<br >
terribly bright flash accompanied by an instant roll of thunder that made<br >
both Susie and I jump out of our skins. I thought it was going to tip it<br >
down but nothing.<br >
<br >
I don't know if it's still received wisdom but I have always filled a new<br >
oil filter with fresh oil and also wiped a smear round the rubber seal. New<br >
copper o-ring on the sump plug and in that went, then oil filter on and<br >
done up hand tight. Proper hand tight, mind.<br >
<br >
I filled the engine until the dipstick registered middle and ran the<br >
engine. No leaks! Belly pan back on, clear up the gas rage and top up the<br >
oil level with another 1/2 litre or so and the dipstick now read max.<br >
<br >
I confess I ran it again, just in case. Still no leaks :)<br >
<br >
&lt;Hoddy&gt; it'll probably catch fire or something on the way to the Chunnel<br >
&lt;/Hoddy&gt;<br >
<br >
Still, I enjoyed my spot of light mechanical activity :)<br >

&gt; &gt; Hi all,<br >
&gt; &gt;<br >
&gt; &gt;<br >
&gt; 1. can anyone recommend a way to get out the stuck pistons without a<br >
&gt; pressure hose?<br >
&gt; reassemble, fill with fluid and use the master cylinder to pump them<br >
&gt; out. Or any other master cylinder you can bodge on. It only has to<br >
&gt; work long enough as you flush and clean afterwards<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; 2. Can switch cleaner be used instead of ibupronol for cleaning the<br >
&gt; calipers?<br >
&gt; I use brake cleaner from Halfrauds. Works for me. And smells citrus-y<br >
fresh<br >
&gt;<br >
<br >
I regularly use switch cleaner when I can't find brake cleaner, use it on<br >
the brakes, chainset and most other moving parts after hosing down the MTB<br >
then liberally apply gt85. I usually gear the rear suspension about every<br >
five rides and then oil the chainset again before riding.<br >
<br >
&gt; 3. Any top tips for stripping down the sticky lever to get that working<br >
&gt; properly?<br >
&gt; strip it, clean it, clean it again, clean it some more, then<br >
&gt; re-assemble. Is it the lever or the piston? How old is the kit? maybe<br >
&gt; worth doing that as well.<br >
&gt;<br >
<br >
I tend to blow it through with the hose then the aforementioned switch<br >
cleaner until things appear to be clean and then again with the gt85.<br >
<br >
I do seem to be repairing a spate of bottom brackets from friends bikes at<br >
the moment, usually the ones who don't clean them :/<br >
<br >
Bruce<br >
<br >
&gt; TBH, I suspect the motorbike stuff will be easier as it's bigger,<br >
&gt; heavier and more likely to be actually designed for overhaul rather<br >
&gt; than on the assumption it will be thrown away as unfashionable before<br >
&gt; repair is needed.<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; Otherwise, some other points<br >
&gt; refilling a brake line is an arse, it takes ages to get the bubbles<br >
&gt; out, best to get it &quot;right-ish&quot;, leave it tied on overnight and try<br >
&gt; again<br >
&gt; seals are a pain<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; beyond that, as long as you have a suitable manual, it's not that<br >
&gt; tricky, but clean everything lots of times (and dry any water out)<br >
&gt; before re-assembling<br >

&gt; Hi all,<br >
&gt;<br >
&gt; The brakes on the mountain bike need a bit of attention after the rear<br >

<br >
Silly question: it's not a shimano brake is it? They don't use DOT<br >
fluid...They use LHM or expensive shimano fluid if you prefer
