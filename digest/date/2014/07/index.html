&gt;Now he's got in touch asking me to remove it and he'll refund me.<br >
I bought a pen off someone that neglected to mention the nib had been<br >

Like you I decided negative feedback was the way to go. He winged like<br >
a B'stard that I had done that and said I was just upset because I had<br >
bought a damaged item.<br >
<br >
He eventually said he'd refund half the cost if I paid return postage,<br >
but only if I removed the feedback, I, not very politely, told him to<br >
fcuk himself. I'd remove the feedback after he'd refunded me 100% of<br >
the cost plus return postage, plus a 1 pound contribution towards the<br >
petrol I'd use getting it to my local post office. I also told him I'd<br >
only return it &quot;recorded delivery&quot; because he was an untrustworthy,<br >
low life.<br >
He refused so I said fine it was only 16 quid I'd keep the pen and he<br >
could keep the feedback.<br >
<br >
He very reluctantly agreed and paid it to get rid of the feedback. So<br >
in answer to your question...<br >
&gt;Am I right in assuming that if I do remove it, I can no longer do anything and he has no &gt;incentive to refund me?<br >
I'd say yes, you've hit the nail very squarely on the head.<br >
<br >
&gt;I feel I ought to let him refund me first.<br >
I think that would be a &quot;Good Thing&quot;.<br >
<br >
Of course as much as I enjoyed the annoyance my attitude toward the<br >
Welsh twat caused (did I mention that he was from Wales and was a<br >
twat?), I do think if we all stuck to our principles and said &quot;keep my<br >
cash and the feedback&quot; there would be fewer scumbags dealing on ebay.<br >
But then I also think if we had a pointless war every 20 years (as<br >
we've done throughout ages past) we'd get rid of about 70% of the<br >
scrotes, we now pay to produce more scrotes.<br >

	Regular readers may recall that eBay had stopped sending me emails =<br >
showing newly listed items corresponding to my saved searches.=20<br >
I had another shot at their helldesk a couple of days ago , and they =<br >
suggested I &quot;resave&quot; my searches to see if this restored the flow of =<br >
emails. I went through them all one at a time, &quot;Unfollowed&quot; them, =<br >
refollowed them and sure enough my inbox is now full of emails offering =<br >
flogging spanners, torque multipliers &amp;c. &amp;c.<br >
Looking through various forums, it seems this has been a hit-and-miss =<br >
affair; some people were unaffected, some had only a few searches fail =<br >
to send emails and some, like me, weren't getting anything.<br >
