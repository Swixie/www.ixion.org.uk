	<p class="authorDate">Posted by &quot;Ian Ellison&quot; &lt;ian-at-ianellison.org.uk&gt; on 30 November 2014 | <a href="/digest/0.91890500 1417374903/#PageComments_holder" title="View Comments Posted">0 Comments</a></p>
	
	A few weeks ago the Kawasaki Z750S got knocked over while parked out the<br >
front. I had to replace a footpeg and an indicator, but the crash bars<br >
mainly protected the bodywork, with only a coupel of tiny marks on the =<br >
top<br >
fairing and tailpiece.=20<br >
<br >
Last time I moved it I notice a click from the left hand front, once per<br >
wheel rev. I wondered if the disc had been bent or dislodged on the semi<br >
floating bobbins, so I went for a short ride as a test.=20<br >
<br >
First time I braked there was a bit of slack to take up but then it =<br >
braked<br >
normally. However when going slow you could feel and hear the click.<br >
<br >
Got back and did a visual inspection. No bright spots, no signs of =<br >
rubbing,<br >
and the left hand disc was stone cold. Right hand side was mildly warm.=20<br >
<br >
I removed the left hand caliper and worked the pistons back and forth a =<br >
few<br >
times then pushed them back into the caliper, refitted,  pumped it up =<br >
and<br >
tried again. It all seems to be fine now.=20<br >
<br >
All I can think is that the pad got knocked at an angle when the bike =<br >
went<br >
over and was either rubbing on the disc or was being pushed by pressure =<br >
in<br >
the system when braking but couldn't move due to geometric locking.<br >
<br >
Any other ideas?=20<br >
<br >
Also sorry Joe, but I need to  move it on as I need to pay for the =<br >
Triumph.=20<br >
<br >
Anyone want it for a bit less than I paid Joe for it? Say =A31300? I'm =<br >
going<br >
to be advertising it elsewhere for =A31500. It's a 2006 Z750S, 31000 =<br >
miles,<br >
Renntec luggage rack, Joe's very neat heated grip installation, MoT<br >
01.03.15.<br >

&gt; Any ixies have a quadcopter by any chance,<br >
<br >
No, but I'd like one :-)<br >
<br >
&gt; Far scarier than you might realise, just the fact you have 2kg/&Acirc;&pound;1000<br >
&gt; flying around at speed is enough to add an edge.<br >
<br >
Mrr, well the cost is one reason I don't have one.<br >
<br >
&gt; Little vid I did recently just before autumn.<br >
<br >
Oooh nice :-)  You do seem to live in the flat back end of beyond<br >
though.  Far easier to fly a 'copter there than the heavily populated<br >
environs of Brighton.  Elf &amp; Safety + all that jazz.<br >

&gt; 3. The OED usually uses the Z version of a word with the S version<br >
&gt; almost always listed as a variant spelling of the Z form<br >
<br >
I discovered that we used z in the past &amp; the s variation is fairly<br >
recent usage.  Hence the OED is correct.  Bah!  Hate having to admit<br >
the 'murricans are correct ;-)<br >

&gt; I am absolutely refusing to have anything to do with anything Black<br >
&gt; Friday. I see it as US cultural imperialism, like Halloween and<br >
&gt; taxing Boris Johnson.<br >
<br >
I'm with you on Black Friday &amp; the US attempting to tax Boris, but<br >
Hallo'een didn't originate in the US of A, they simply adopted the<br >
tradition &amp; melded it to suit their own desires.  Trick or treat<br >
existed in Scotland long before the US took it to heart.<br >
<br >
As for Black Friday, I'm somewhat amused by some companies having<br >
a &quot;Black Friday&quot; week.  WTF?  Friday is a day, not a week!<br >
<br >
With regard to Boris, like I give a flying fsck whether the US<br >
want to tax him.  He won't pay. The man is an idiot, but not that<br >
much of an idiot.<br >
