8.1 was handy -- multithreaded Finder, so you could do stuff during<br >

	On Saturday 23rd May, many many people will be descending on<br >
Birmingham as it is Gay Pride weekend.<br >
<br >
In a completely unrelated event, Kaz has been the prime organiser of<br >
the Birmingham Buskathon, also on Saturday 23rd May, which will<br >
feature ten or so acoustic artists performing at a couple of busking<br >
locations in Birmingham. The intention is to raise money for the Jan<br >
Foundation, an organisation which provides help and support for<br >
victims of domestic violence around Brum -<br >
http://www.janfoundation.co.uk/<br >
<br >
So, if any of you are around Brum that day, please drop by and say<br >
hello - for those who don't know, I'll be the bald fat<br >
harassed-looking one somewhere near the mixing desk (or possibly on<br >
the stage) and Kaz is the silver-haired cuddly one who'll be harassing<br >
me.<br >
<br >
Any publicity for the event would also be very welcome.<br >

&gt; Hi Folks,<br >
&gt; <br >
&gt; &gt;&gt; Google maps<br >
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br >
&gt; &gt;&gt; WTF have they done?<br >
&gt; <br >
&gt; Completely borked for me in Firefox:<br >
&gt; <br >
&gt; https://maps.google.co.uk<br >
&gt; <br >
&gt; gives &quot;Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the<br >
&gt; request for this address in a way that will never complete.&quot;<br >
&gt; <br >
&gt; Works in Chrome but dumps me on the new variant.  Ho Hm<br >
<br >
I just encountered this. When I looked at the URL in the address bar,<br >
it had display=classic or something similar in it and it came back if<br >
I removed it. So I went into Options | Privacy | Remove individual<br >
cookies, did a sarch for google, and removed all the google.co.uk<br >
cookies, after which it worked.<br >

We use &quot;Stand by me&quot; to soundcheck (don't know why as I don't do<br >
backing vocals on it so it's not the ideal song to soundcheck with).<br >
That will be a bit tributey at tomorrow night's gig.<br >

The roof just by where the cat walks along the fence is<br >
lion.roof.almost. almost.roof.lion, however, is some way away. Can't<br >
help but think that with six times as many words you could have a<br >
system where the order of the words doesn't matter.<br >
