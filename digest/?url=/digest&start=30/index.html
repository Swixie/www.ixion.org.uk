	You may remember that last week I was asking advice about getting some<br >
brackets made. Well that very nice man Andy Pugh made them for me without<br >
even being asked.<br >
<br >
They arrived by post today:<br >
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13621505/IMG_20140614_093620.jpg<br >
(Complete with rounded ends and corners which were on my 'proper' drawing<br >
but not on the rough one.)<br >
<br >
They fit perfectly.<br >
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13621505/IMG_20140614_135108.jpg<br >
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13621505/IMG_20140614_135059.jpg<br >
<br >
Which considering I measured the distance between the holes with a steel<br >
rule, and specified 8mm holes for 8mm screws is somewhat of a miracle.<br >
<br >
So, a huge thank you to Andy.<br >
<br >
Cheers.<br >

&gt; That fixed it. The radiator used to look a bit clogged. It was when I had a <br >

&gt; To give you some idea of how bad it was the temperature gauge was reading <br >

Hmm, that's a bit worrying, my ZZR1200 has taken to running a lot<br >
warmer than it used to (in the coolant department).  The fans come on<br >
when they should, just more often and in cooler weather than they used<br >
to.<br >
<br >
How much did your re-core cost?<br >

The 800 will be much lighter, much more economic (60mpg instead of 45mpg)<br >
and easier to chuck around. Oh and the gearbox will be rather easier to<br >
use. The boxer engine has more character though.<br >
<br >
&gt; I'd anticipate the 800 is lighter and probably generally less<br >
&gt; intimidating, but effective seat height depends so much on seat shape<br >
&gt; and width, it is hard to judge in advance<br >
<br >
I agree. It also depends on the inside leg &amp; general mass of the rider.<br >
<br >
&gt; The speed limit is low enough and penalties are heavy enough in Norway<br >
&gt; that I'd go with the 800.<br >
<br >
I would anyhow. Although I wouldn't want the R variant of either<br >
personally. On a long trip I'd want more fairing.<br >
